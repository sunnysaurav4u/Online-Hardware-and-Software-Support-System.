<li><b>Camera Lens Is Broken Or Hazy</b></li>
<b>Solution:</b>If you have a hazy or scratched camera lens, the very first thing I would do is give it a really, really good clean. You’d be surprised how much of a difference that can make. And don’t just give it a quick wipe with a cloth. Get out the methylated spirits or spray and wipe and really make sure it's clean.<br>


<li><b>Unresponsive Touch Screen</b></li>
<b>Solution:</b>If you find that your screen is unresponsive to touch, there are few things you can try. Most people I have spoken to with this issue managed to solve it with the old turn it off and on again trick. So definitely give that a go if you haven’t already.Another option is restoring the phone back to its factory settings. Here are the instructions for Android and for iPhone.In the course of my research, I did see some other sites recommending holding your touch screen against an open flame or repeatedly bashing on the screen. I urge you all not to try these. Methods like those will often cause more harm than good.If the touch screen functionality is actually busted, you’ll need to get the screen replaced. You can see the recommendations for replacing a broken screen above.<br>




<li><b>Water Damage</b></li>
<b>Solution:</b>If you’ve dropped your phone in a pool or just spilled water on it TURN IT OFF IMMEDIATELY.The water itself does not cause damage to the phone — it’s the short circuits that occur when your phone’s electricity meets water that cause the problem. Whether you have an iPhone, Android, Windows Phone .Now you need to focus on getting your phone dry.If you have a phone that opens: Like a Samsung or Sony, you’re in luck. Take the back off and pull the battery out. Give everything a really thorough wipe down. If you just spilled a littler water on your phone, this should be sufficient to keep your phone in shape. If the device was fully submerged or you want to be extra cautious, keep reading.If you have an iPhone: Your situation is a little trickier because you can’t pull your phone apart and clean any water out. There are few things you can try, like putting your phone in a bag of rice for 48 hours, grabbing a bunch of silica gel packets and placing them in a zip lock with your phone or even a Bheestie bag — which I have heard very good things about.Once you’ve picked your method, store your phone in a cool dry place and make sure it's sitting in a way that allows any liquid to drain i.e. on a slant or sitting on one of the edges.After using one of those methods, you should be ready to turn your phone on again. If you have an iPhone and you want to be completely sure that there is no water damage before you turn your phone back on, this video will show you the locations of the water damage indicators. If the indicators are red, you might want to leave it on rice for another day.<br>

<li><b>Google Play Store Crashing</b></li>
<b>Solution:</b>If Google Play crashes after launching it, you might have a corrupt cache. Most of the time, simply wiping its cache fixes the problem. Most versions of Android use generally the same steps. Go to:Settings Apps Swipe right to locate the “all” tab Locate Google Play Store and wipe cache and dataRestart your phone If that fails, you might want to try wiping data and/or cache for the following services:<br>
<li><b>Google Play Services</b></li>
<b>Solution:</b>Google Services Framework Remember to restart the device after performing the wipes.<br>


<li><b>Insufficient Space on Device</b></li>

<b>Solution:</b>Android allocates fixed storage space for apps. Users can’t expand it. So you might run into this error even if your device indicates a great deal of remaining storage capacity.The easiest way to free up space is to begin uninstalling apps. However, if you use music apps, like Spotify, you might not be able to find where the files are being stored. The quickest way to free up space is to use an app like CCleaner. If you want to get a visual display of where all your memory is going, try using DiskUsage. It will visually display your files’ locations and size.<br>

<li><b></>I Can’t Find My Download</b></li>

<b>Solution:</b>Android by default stores its downloaded files in a folder called “Download”. To locate the Download directory, first install a file manager, like ES File Explorer (our review of ES File Explorer). Once installed, go to sdcard/Download and you should see a complete list of downloaded files.<br>

<li><b>I Installed Malware!</b></li>

<b>Solution:</b>Never install a cracked game or app — it probably has malware on it. But if you already have malware, simply uninstall the culprit. If you’re not sure which app is wreaking mayhem on your phone, try a malware scanner. If that fails, use some of our tips on finding Android malware.<br>

<li><b>Android Device Crashes on Boot</b></li>

<b>Solution:</b>If your phone no longer boots, you can enter what’s called “safe mode” — we’ve covered Android’s safe mode before. Safe Mode allows users to disable all startup apps that might be crashing the phone. Once booted in through safe mode, you can then remove the misbehaving app<br>
