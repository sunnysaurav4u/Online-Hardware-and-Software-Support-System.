	<li><b>Errors in the software or the operating system installed.</b></li> 

	<b>Solution</b>Some software packages (especially those of dubious origins) can damage the computer because of errors within their own ranks; they can even cause operating systems to become unusable, during initial installation, during use, while doing a specific combination of jobs, or if incompatible with other types of software working at the same time. As long as software errors do not accumulate they are unlikely to announce themselves.<br>


	<li><b>Blank monitors</b></li>

	<b>Solution</b>Blank monitors are among the most common computer problems. Most people who have computers will have dealt with non-working blank monitor at least once. The first thing to do is to check the supply cord and power systems. Sometimes, the video cable may be loosened. In this case, push the video cable into place again. If you can access another monitor, connect it to the CPU and see if it works. If it does, the problem is in the monitor or its wire.Sometimes the monitor may display strange colors. Make sure that all the pins are properly secured on the CPU.<br>

	<li><b>Hard drive is dead</b></li>

	<b>Solution</b>A dead hard drive is a major hardware problem because it usually involves considerable expenses. The only possible thing you can do is to try and recover as much data as you can from the hard drive. There are specialized software available that can do this. Alternatively, you can also take it to a hard drive recovery expert.<br>


	<li><b>Error when booting</b></li>

	<b>Solution</b>Errors on boot usually happen during reboots. Some error messages will be self-explanatory but others may be technical. Make sure that all the wires that lead to the computer are properly pushed in. Sometimes, floppy disks and external hard drives can also cause error problems. Remove them and try to reboot.<br>

	<li><b>Starting problems</b></li>

	<b>Solution</b>If you are unable to start your computer, the best thing to do then is to restart the system and choose an existing configuration like Safe Mode or Last known Stable Configuration. The Safe Mode is the best option to choose because it will give the computer a chance to analyze the problem as well as adjust to new settings.<br>

	<li><b>Shutdown problems</b></li>

	<b>Solution</b>It can happen that the computer shuts down suddenly or it takes a long time to shut down. If you are facing these situations, it is best to look into the problem deeply. There may be a serious and bigger problem involved than just the computer shutting down.<br>

	<li><b>Obsolete software</b></li>
	 <b>Solution:</b>Software that no longer works due to new hardware or support software changes - This refers to software that is based on functions found in older versions of databases and operating systems. An example of this can be found in old COBOL code that will not compile on new compilers due to the use of verbs that are no longer supported in the compiler. Many vendors try to make new releases of support software upwardly compatible, but there are usually cases where one minor area of non-support from the base system can cause a major revision of the system. The only other option is not to upgrade the support software. This decision can be justified for the short-term, but a point is usually reached where the software must either be replaced or modified.<br>

	<li><b>Incorrect or inadequate interfaces with other systems</b></li>
	 <b>Solution:</b>This means that the software does not correctly accept input (data, control, parameters, etc.) from other systems or sends incorrect output (data, control, parameters, print, etc.) to other systems. An example of this is when a system has an electronic data interfaces (EDI) with external systems, but does not correctly receive or format the information.<br>

 	<li><b>Inadequate security controls</b></li>
 	 <b>Solution:</b> This means that unauthorized access to the system is not adequately controlled and detected. In addition, people may also be able to perform transactions in excess of the authorization levels appropriate for their job functions. For example, a person without managerial levels of security access might be able to approve their own overtime. Or, a person not in the payroll department might be able to view the employee payroll files.<br>


	<li><b>Wireless problems can occur because of several reasons (router, computer, ISP)</b></li>
	 <b>Solution:</b>If your Wi-Fi signal is weak, it can cause disconnections and slowness, so make sure you’re in range and are getting decent reception. Next check that your computer’s wireless adapter has up-to-date drivers. If none of this works, call your ISP and see if they can help.<br>
